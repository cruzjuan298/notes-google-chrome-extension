## Introduction

This notes app was created for quick access to jot down notes (I'm guilty of forgetting many things, so this is also helpful to me). It utilizes local storage to ensure that your notes are saved on your laptop, PC, or whatever machine you're using. DISCLAIMER: As with any documentation application, DO NOT WRITE SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN YOUR NOTES!

## Features

List the key features of your project using bullet points for easy readability.

- Storing: As mentioned before, your notes are stored via local storage, ensuring that they are always accessible.
- Editing: You can seamlessly edit notes on-demand, and the updated notes are accessible thanks to its local storage integration.
- Deleting: To delete a note, double-click the note you want to delete. You will be prompted to confirm whether or not you intend to delete the note. Please note that there is currently no undo option, so the confirmation step is necessary.

## Technologies Used

Vanilla JavaScript was used to create functionality for the extension, while the user interface was designed using Figma and implemented with HTML and CSS.
